# Wacky-Activity-Randomizer-Selector
Developed a web application with a recommender system that randomizes activities customized to a user's profile, while leveraging on a microservice architecture. Users are given the option to Select/ Refresh the page to view other suggested activities. With our in-built loyalty programme, completion of activities will award users with reward points that can be used to exchange for attractive prizes on the rewards catalogue. <br />

Due to travel restrictions during the COVID pandemic, many activities are left undiscovered and locals struggle to find alternative activites/ hobbies. Moreover, these activities lack the publicity or do not attract the right audiences. This web application aims to aid users build a profile where it will select from a pool of activities that closely matches the interests of the user.
